Creating a fully functional ATM interface in Python involves simulating key ATM operations, such as checking balances, depositing funds, withdrawing money, and updating user information.
Explanation:
ATM Class:
The ATM class represents an ATM machine with accounts and basic operations (deposit, withdraw, check balance).It initializes with a sample set of accounts (account number, PIN, and balance

Authentication:
The authenticate method asks for an account number and PIN to validate the user.If the account number and PIN match, the user is logged in; otherwise, the authentication fails.

Operations:
Check Balance: Displays the user'scurrent balance.
Deposit: Allows the user to deposit money into their account.
Withdraw: Allows the user to withdraw money, checking if sufficient funds are available.

Menu and Loop:
The show_menu method displays the main ATM menu.
The run method starts the ATM process and keeps the user interacting until they log out or choose to exit.

Security:
The ATM uses getpass to securely input the PIN without displaying it on the screen.

Key Features:

Simple Authentication:
It checks the account number and PIN.
Menu System:
Displays options for the user to interact with the ATM.
Deposit/Withdrawal:
Ensures basic validation (e.g., preventing negative amounts or withdrawals greater than the balance).This example can be expanded further by adding features like transferring funds between accounts, saving transaction history, or adding more accounts.
